# World-Health-Glance-Year2014
This visualization attempts to see how the world performed in terms of 4 key important health indicators

Nations have struggled through many decades, to bring down their Infant Mortality Rates (IMR) and to increase the chances of live births. With the help of Visualization, I am trying to explore if there are any associations/ patterns that emerge when we try to compare two different parameters. By including Healthcare GDP, I am also trying to see if the economic status of the country has any role on IMR.

Some Interesting Patterns:

1. IMR drops suddenly below 20 per 1000 births as soon as the Healthcare GDP per capita grows roughly above 500 USD

2. Most of the least developing countries probably due to lack of sex-education and family planning show more fertility and also more IMR. Hence, we can infer that possibly more number of births equates to more IMR

3. Unfortunately, in less developed countries where there is less spend on healthcare, increased births rates are recorded. This leads to added pressure of increasing population on limited healthcare facilities, and hence less access to healthcare for common people.
